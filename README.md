## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
//Hey welcome to metric converter!
 System.out.println("Welcome to Metric Converter! ");

    System.out.println(
        "My application enables you to convert from metric to imperial units. Following are the available options - ");
    System.out.println("Please enter a valid input - following are the options :");
    System.out.println("Press 1 to convert cm to in");
    System.out.println("Press 2 to convert km to mile");
    System.out.println("Press 3 to convert gm to ounce");
    System.out.println("Press 4 to convert kg to lb");
